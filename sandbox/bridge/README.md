# Development Environment Walkthrough

As part of this walkthrough, we are going to experiment with a few different scenarios:

1. **Local Development**: We will run the application locally on our machine.
   - **Scenario 1: Token Risks**: We will develop a protocol that leverages tokens that get exploited, and use a Trap to mitigate the risk.
   - **Scenario 2: Bridge Risks**: We will develop a protocol that leverages a bridge that gets exploited, and use a Trap to mitigate the risk.
2. **Chain Fork Development**: We will run the application locally on our machine, but with a fork of a chain.

   - **Scenario 3: Olympus DAO Exploit**: An advanced example where we will simulate an exploit on Olympus DAO and use a Trap to mitigate the risk.
   - **Scenario 4: Nomad Exploit**: An advanced example where we will simulate an exploit on Nomad and use a Trap to mitigate the risk.
