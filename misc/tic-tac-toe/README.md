# Tic-Tac-Toe Trap

## Introduction

Drosera traps can be used for much more than just monitoring blockchain exploits. In our fun tic-tac-toe smart contract we will leverage traps to monitor and update our tic-tac-toe game board. This allows us to leverage traps to do expensive compute of our game off-chain to verify pending moves and then automate the finalized moves.

In this simple example we can simulate two players making moves on a tic-tac-toe board. The trap then analyzes the moves every block to validate the move is legal, and if there is a draw/win. Once this is done if the pending move from the player is valid the traps `shouldRespond` function is triggered and the users response function is fired off with data to be passed in as arguments.

Our example contract has a function only callable by Drosera as a response `finalizeMove()`. The trap passes the response data which is then used within the function to check if the game is over and emits events accordingly.

## Conclusion

The integration of Drosera traps into our tic-tac-toe smart contract demonstrates a powerful use case for off-chain computation and automated verification. By leveraging Drosera, we offload the heavy computational tasks of validating moves and determining game outcomes, ensuring that our smart contract remains efficient and cost-effective.

This example highlights how Drosera can enhance the functionality of smart contracts by providing a mechanism for continuous monitoring and validation. The traps analyze each move made by the players, validate its legality, and determine if the game has reached a win or draw state. Once validated, the finalizeMove() function is triggered, ensuring that only legitimate moves update the game state.

Through this simple example, we not only maintain the integrity and fairness of the game but also demonstrate the broader potential of Drosera traps in automating and securing complex smart contract operations outside of exploits.
